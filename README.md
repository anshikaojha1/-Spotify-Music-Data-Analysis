#üéµ **Spotify Music Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project** üéß  

### **üìå Project Overview**  
This project explores **Spotify‚Äôs vast music dataset** to uncover trends, analyze song popularity, and build machine learning models for genre classification and song recommendation. Using **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**, we extract insights from audio features and predict song characteristics.  

### **üîç Key Questions & Analysis**  

‚úÖ **1. Average Popularity of Music Genres**  
- Analyzed the average popularity of different genres to see which ones dominate the charts.  
- Visualized genre popularity trends using bar charts and interactive plots.

‚úÖ **2. Top 10 Most Popular Artists Based on Average Track Popularity**  
- Identified the most successful artists by calculating their **average song popularity**.  
- Created an interactive graph to showcase the top 10 artists.

‚úÖ **3. Do More Danceable Songs Tend to Be More Popular?**  
- Explored the relationship between **danceability and popularity** using statistical analysis and visualizations.  
- Used regression techniques to determine if higher danceability leads to more popular songs.

‚úÖ **6. Song Recommendation System Based on a Track‚Äôs Features**  
- Built a **content-based recommendation system** using **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**.  
- Recommended similar songs based on danceability, energy, loudness, valence, and tempo.  
- Provided song suggestions using **fast nearest-neighbor search**.  

### **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **FAISS** (for fast similarity search in the recommendation system)  
- **Machine Learning Models** (Regression & Classification)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)  

### **üöÄ Insights & Findings**  
- Certain **genres are consistently more popular** than others.  
- **Danceability has a weak/moderate correlation with popularity**.  
- **Machine learning models can predict genres with good accuracy**.  
- **The recommendation system successfully suggests similar songs** based on audio features.
